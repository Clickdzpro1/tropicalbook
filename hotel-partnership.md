Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about our hotel parking partnership program.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**One question:** Does [Hotel Name] have unused parking spaces that sit empty most days?

If yes, we can help you generate $500-2,000/month from them - with zero work on your part.

Worth a 10-minute conversation? 

Reply with a good time to chat, or call me directly: 954-278-1990

Thanks!
